# 3D_Printing_Using_C
Generate gcode for CURA slicer to make simple geometrical shapes using C++ codes. 

Start from the word files named Session <n> starting from Session 1. This will explain what we are trying to do and what the problem statement is. 
The solutions and explanations are in the Answer Sheet Session <n> word files. 
The codes are cpp files. There is a lot of redundancy in the codes as different shapes and configurations are tried in each. 
The final items to be 3D printed using a commercial DIY 3D printer are the gcode files.
The purpose of this code and this entire repository is to learn to code in C++ and learn about plastic 3D printing at the same time. 
Go through the program to learn how to generate gcode for the geometrical shapes you would like to try and print using the settings for your own 3D printer and then print them as a souvenir of your learning!
